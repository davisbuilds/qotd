## 🤖 Agent Setup

New here? Paste the prompt below into your coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) and it will install, verify, and tell you how to launch the app.

```text
Set up the `qotd` repo for me. It's a "Quote of the Day" single-page web app
(Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind) with auto-refresh, favorites, and
dark-mode-first theming. All quote data is static JSON — no env vars or secrets.

Do this, in order:
1. Install deps. Prereqs: Node 18.17+ and pnpm. Run `pnpm install` from the repo
   root. Clone https://github.com/davisbuilds/qotd.git and cd in first if needed.
2. Verify it builds: run `pnpm lint` then `pnpm build`. Both should pass. If either
   fails, show me the error and stop.
3. Report back: confirm lint + build passed, and give me the command to run it
   (`pnpm dev`, then open http://localhost:3000).

Don't commit anything.

## 📝 Adding More Quotes

To add more quotes, edit `data/quotes.json`:

```json
{
  "id": ##,
  "quote": "Your inspirational quote here",
  "author": "Author Name"
}
```

Then rebuild the application.

## 🐛 Development Notes

- Auto-refresh interval: 2 minutes (120,000ms) - configurable in `lib/constants.ts`
- Theme defaults to dark mode and persists in localStorage
- Hydration-safe theme detection using `theme !== 'light'` pattern prevents flash
- Favorites persist in localStorage with key `qotd-favorites`
- API route prevents caching with `force-dynamic` and no-cache headers to ensure random quotes
- Smooth fade transitions: 700ms duration with scale and translate effects
- Elegant hover effects: translateY(-2px) with cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) easing
- Each quote has a unique ID for favorites tracking
- Custom CSS animations for subtle pulse effects and loading shimmer

### 🔄 Migration from Python Desktop Widget

This project was originally a Python CustomTkinter desktop widget and has been completely refactored into a modern Next.js web application. The original Python code is archived in `old_python_app/` for reference.

**Why the refactor?**
- ✅ Cross-platform (works everywhere - desktop, mobile, tablet)
- ✅ No installation required (just open in browser)
- ✅ Easy to share (just send a link)
- ✅ Modern tech stack with better tooling
- ✅ Easier to deploy and maintain
- ✅ More beautiful and performant UI
